## Setup Guide (Local)

A batch script has been created for your convenience in starting up the application.

This step may take several minutes on your first run, as you will be required to download all the dependencies, so do be
patient. Subsequent runs will be quick.

#### For Windows

```batch
.\run.bat
```

#### For Linux / Mac OSX

```shell
./run.sh
```

> **NOTE:** Amend the `JAVA_HOME` in this batch script to the Java JDK 17 directory on your device.

Alternatively, you may start the app by entering `mvnw spring-boot:run` into the terminal from the root of this project
folder.
